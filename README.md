## Quick Start

### What You Need
- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key (for art generation)

### Installation

1. **Clone and install:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personality-discovery-hub.git
cd personality-discovery-hub
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Get OpenAI API Key:**
   - Visit [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Create account and generate API key
   - Keep your key secure (starts with `sk-`)

3. **Run the app:**
```bash
cd app
streamlit run 0_main_hub.py
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`

## How to Use

1. **Choose your path:** Scenario Assessment or AI Art Generator
2. **Follow the prompts:** Answer questions authentically  
3. **Get results:** View analysis or download artwork
4. **Try both apps:** Each offers a different perspective
